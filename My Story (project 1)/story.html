   <p><font size ="6">He had many doubts in his mind before sitting on the throne. Finally one day, he called the great teacher of the kingdom. "Welcome, great teacher!" said the prince. "What is it bothers you, Oh great Prince?" asked the great teacher."Iam going to be a King soon but I don't know if I will be a good King! I don't know what qualities I must possess," said the Prince sadly. "Hmm...Maybe I can help. Do you eat vegetables?" asked the great teacher. "Yes, I do! But I don't like vegetables!" replied the prince</font></p>

<div style="background-color:lightgreen">
<p><font size ="6">"Maybe you have not noticed, but there is so much they can tech us" told te great teacher. The prince was unable to understand. The great tacher said , "Sometimes you must be the Brinjal-richh,purple and fitted with crown and pumpkin-growing humbly on the ground. Stand like ladyfingers-beautiful, slender and tall and friendly like potato. For criminals you will be a Bitter Gourd." The prince was shocked to see how the teacher was relating the prince duties with the vegetables.</font></p>
</div>
<div style="background-color:lightpink">
<p><font size ="6"> The teacher continued, "But with the good you will be like beatroot, yout words should leave a stain. But in front of elders and teachers, like radish, you must be plain. Sometimes like the smell of Onion, you must make your enemies weep but like the Cauliflower, you must keep your people happly!"</font></p>
</div>
<div style="background-color:brown">
<p><font size ="6">"Wow! What a lesson that was! It solves all my problems." said the Prince and thanked the teacher. "I am glad to help you, oh future  king!" said the teacher. From that day Prince ate all the vegetables and became the best king in the Kingdom could ever have.
